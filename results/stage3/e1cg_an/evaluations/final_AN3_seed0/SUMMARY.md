# Final-checkpoint evaluation

| Sampler | Undiscounted return (mean ± s.e.) | Discounted return (mean ± s.e.) | x0 saturation |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| train | 3912.35 ± 59.9394 | 1390.01 ± 18.1775 | 0.0705729 |
| eval | 4293.24 ± 52.6131 | 1517.28 ± 15.1723 | 0.073009 |

Seed initialized once; each repeat collects train then eval, with continuous policy RNG across repeats. Pretrained repeat 0 has the same policy-RNG prefix as each one-repeat checkpoint job. DDPM deterministic=True still adds noise at t>0, and zero noise at t=0. Seed 5000 aligns policy RNG streams across checkpoints, but the existing wrapper does not seed Gym's underlying np_random generator, so initial environment states are not fully paired; environment seeding remains unchanged.

Episode standard error uses sample SD (ddof=1)/sqrt(n); 160 episodes per selected sampler.

action_oor_frac uses physical actions sent to Gym after the wrapper's float32 affine unnormalization; policy_action_oor_frac separately uses normalized policy coordinates.
